I am onto any.run which is a web-based malware analysis platform https://app.any.run/ which is publicly available to anyone.  

Easy way to kick off is to get a malware file that is already submitted by other people.  
To do this, click on public report on the left.

Click on the filter icon on top right corner, this will help getting the malware file I want.

Once the filter page opens up, click the Verdict dropdown and choose Malicious option, click on Search.

This will filter in all results with only malicious files/malwares
